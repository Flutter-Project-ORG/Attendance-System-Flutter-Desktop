# attendance_system_flutter_desktop
A student attendance system is needed to measure student participation in the classroom, especially at Yarmouk University. Several attendance systems have been proposed based on manual attendance. This is a very important problem. Management requires careful follow-up, care and no indulgence. The previous systems are inefficient in term of processing time and low in accuracy. This project aims to propose a student attendance system using the QR Code technology based on mobile application. To ensure the student attends in the classroom, the QR Code contained the time information which is generated and displayed at lecturer presentation. The student needs only to scan the displayed QR Code using his/her android smartphone. The code then will be sent to a server for attendance process. The proposed work was designed and implemented using Android Studio and VS Code. The experimental result shows that the proposed attendance system need only 0.000030s to recognize the QR Codes in the server.

```bash
pip install foobar
```
